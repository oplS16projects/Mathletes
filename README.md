# Project Title: Math Adventures

### Statement

Some of the smartest people still can't do basic arithmitic. Say goodbye to boring flashcards and hello to a new fun innovative way to learn basic addition, subtraction, multiplication and division! Our team is going to set out to create a game that makes learning fun. It will allow users to select a character and then move over tiles to collect a specific number of items that solve a basic arithmitic problem. Users will have to collect the correct number of items to solve the problem. If they collect the correct number of items they are awarded points! 

We hope that this project will enable us to learn more about Racket libraries and enhance our abilities of coding in racket specifically using higher order procedures and object oriented programming. 

### Analysis

This project will allow us to learn more about Racket Libraries and to demonstrate our knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming as well as Higher-Order Procedures. 

The Racket libraries we plan on using include the racket/draw library because it provides basic drawing tools, the racket/gui library because it provides GUI widgets such as windows, buttons, checkboxes and text fields, and the 2htdp/image and 2htdp/planetcute libraries. The image library will be used for construction of basic images and the planet cute library will be used to for the charachter images and board tiles.

In order to allow the user to select a charachter we will need to use conditionals to check which charachter the user selected and then we will need to update the player's image accordingly. Next we will create a list of arithmetic problems and use higher-order procedures to construct a function that displays the arithmetic problems successively.  

Finally, we will display the board by stacking tiles on top of each other and implementing collision checking to see if the player is on an item or on the check answer tile. If they player is on an item we will change the image of the tile and increment the number of items tile. If the user is  on the check answer tile we will call the method to check if the number of items the user collected is the same as the answer to the problem. If they are equal, then the user will be awarded a certain number of points otherwise an error message will be displayed.   

### Data set or other source materials

The main resources we plan on using come from Racket Documentation:
 
  * racket/draw:        https://docs.racket-lang.org/draw/Drawing_Conveniences.html
  
  * racket/gui library  https://docs.racket-lang.org/gui/index.html
  
  * 2htdp/image         https://docs.racket-lang.org/teachpack/2htdpimage.html
  
  * 2htdp/planetcute:   https://docs.racket-lang.org/teachpack/2htdpPlanet_Cute_Images.html

We will be further exploring all of these libraries and following examples over the weekend prior to actually starting the project. 

### Deliverable and Demonstration

We are creating an interactive game that makes learning fun. The game will start by allowing users to select a character. Once they have made their selection, they will be prompted with various arithmetic challenges. They will have to move over tiles to collect a specific number of items which solve the problem they are prompted with before a timer runs out. Every time the user solves a problem correctly they will be awarded points! During the live demo, students in the class will be able to play the game and challenge others to see who can get the most points. 

### Evaluation of Results

We will consider our project to be successful if we are able to implement the core parts:

1. Allow the user to select a charachter
2. Prompt the User with Math Questions
3. Create a GUI that allows users to navigate over items and select them
4. Implement a method to check for success (whether or not the user solved the math problem correctly)

## Schedule

The Core things that need to be completed in order for our project to be successful include:

1. Allowing the User to Select a Character					
2. Displaying an Arithmetic Problem for the user to solve
3. Displaying a Board consisting of tiles, items to collect and a tile to check answer
4. Allowing the User to Move over the Board
5. Collison Checking to see if the user moved over an item or moved over the check answer tile
6. Point system to allow the user to receive a fixed amount of points if they solved the problem correctly and display next problem

### First Milestone (Fri Apr 15)

The first week we will spend further exploring the Libraries we are using and setting them up. In addition, we will:

  1. Display an Arithmetic Problem
     a. Develop a list of arithmetic problems
     b. Create a function that displays each problem given the number of the problem
     c. Stack one star in the bottom left corner of the board thatâ€™s gold (or whatever color) to represent the check answer method. 

  2. Display the board
     a. Stack a fixed number of tiles
     b. Stack a jewel
     c. Create a character 

The first milestone was officially completed this week! As planned, Rajia:

* Commented Code
* Created Text Field to Display Problem Set
* Created Variables to represent the operands of the problem
* Moved the count label to the left so it's more visually appealing
* Added a star on top of the tile at the bottom corner to represent submit button
* Added text saying "Submit" to that same tile
* Created a list of problems
* Created functions to set the operands to new values
* Created a function that takes a list of problems and sets the current operands to that of the new problem
* Added additional gems 

and Jeremy:

* Setup the board
* Stacked a fixed number of tiles
* Stacked jewels
* Created characters
* Created a count variable and text field to display it
* Displayed a character on the board. 

We are currently on track to finish :) Here is a screenshot of what our work currently looks like:

### Second Milestone (Fri Apr 22)

The second week we will:

  3.  Implement the Select Charachter Feature
      a. Users will be allowed to choose between different charachters they would like to play with
      b. Depending on their selection we will place that charachter on the board. 

  4.  Implement the functionality to allow user to move around the board
      a. The charachter the user choose should be able to move around the board when key strokes are pressed.
      b. Left should move the player left, right should move the player right and Up/Down should move the player respectively.

Milestone #2's Goals were successfully accomplished this week!

Rajia implemented the select character feature. Now users are able to select the charachter they would like to play with by pressing the f1 key. Pressing the f1 key calls the placeChar function which randomly selects a player (either a boy char or girl char). Users can press the f1 key as many times as they like to update their character even after the game has started. 

Rajia also added an instructions section so that users (and Mark) will know how to play the game!

Jeremy implemented movement of the character based on different key strokes. The Left, Right, Up, and Down arrows move the character along the tiles on the screen respectively. He also implemented the functionality so that if the user moves over the jewel in the center, all the jewels disappear and the count is updated.

During Milestone 3 we will modify the code so that collision is detected based on every single tile and only the gem moved on will disappear! 

### Final Presentation (last week of semester)

The final week we will prepare for our final presentation and:

  5. Implement Collision Checking
      a. If a player moves over an item the item should be picked up 
          i. the tile image should change
         ii. a counter should be incremented to represent the number of gemsPicked

      b. If a player moves over the gold tile a method should be called to check the solution of the problem

  6. Implement Check Solution Function and Point System
      a. Given the problem number and the number of gems picked up this function should determine if the solution is correct
      b. If the solution is correct, then the user should be awarded a certain number of points and the points variable should be   incremented accordingly. 

## Group Responsibilities

### Rajia Abdelaziz @rajiaxoxo
will:
 Implement the functionality to select a character,
 Create a list of arithmetic problems and create a function to display the arithmetic problems successively,
 Implement a Method to check if the answer the user entered is correct or not, 
 Implement a system to award points to the user, and help Jeremy with setting up the libraries.

### Jeremy Daigneau @jdaigneau
will: Implement graphics from 2htdp/planetcute to generate what will act as a game board for the character to traverse. Then, implement features from 2htdp/universe to allow the character to be affected by user input to allow for movement around the game board. Finally, I will implement collision detection to show that character obtained and item from the gameboard.
